  1. Create a set of object types that describe a series of related objects that may share behavior and/or attributes. Code the example and another set of classes different from                         the example. Add properties/methods as needed.  

    Example: 
    
    ```javascript
    Shape //{ pEdges, fnDisplay } 
    Quadrilateral is Shape //{ fnArea, fnPerimeter}  
    Square is Quadrilateral //{ } 
    Triangle is Shape //{fnArea, fnPerimeter} 
    ```
    Use of inheritance, prototype, and function overwriting.
